Hi Folks!



I am a retired electrical engineer that started using the NTV.mx Kodi Addon to watch and record Danish television wherever I was with internet access.



The NTV.mx has long gone, but I have maintained and updated the addon reguarely to work with IPTV based on .m3u or .m3u8 files or a link like:



http://<url>/get.php?username=<>&password=<>&type=m3u_plus&output=ts from your IPTV supplier.



If you use mine rytecepg.downloader and install FFMPEG on your device, you can record any program with a single click in the EPG.



Stream all of your favourites sports, movies and tv series from your IPTV provider. Requires a registration and paid subscription. Please register at your IPTV supplier.

Record or display one channel at a time and watch or record as many Direct channels as your hardware and internet can handle.

Add multiroom to allow recording of more channels.

Build in TV Guide that allows you one-click recording and watch or record from archive/catch up.

Record recursively based on text search in your TV guide.

Record from dr.dk nu and BBC iPlayer WWW with special versions of these addons and includes recording of subtitles.

The author does not host or distribute any of the content displayed by this addon. The author does not have any affiliation with the content providers or IPTV Suppliers.
